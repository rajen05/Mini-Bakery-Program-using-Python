** How to use:

1- Open your editer software
2- Go to left top corner > File > Open Folder
3- Select and open folder: #Main Bakery Program
4- Open and run py file: Assignment Bakery(MainProgram).py
5- create a customer account, or open List_Account.csv to choose an account to log in


!! Note:
The entire program is build with Visual Code Studio.
Reason of it is PyCharm does not run as desired while it comes to parts like cls.terminal() from adhocBakerFunctions.py (a function massively used in main program for terminal refreshing).

So to get the best experience and to avoid unexpected interpreting faulties, it is highly recommended to use VS Studio!
